## What Are the Sections of a Literature Review?

In academic writing, the literature review serves as an essential part of your research project. It presents an overview of existing research on a specific topic, helping to highlight gaps, trends, and areas that require further investigation. A well-written literature review is divided into several key sections. Let’s break them down:

### 1. Introduction

The **introduction** sets the stage for your review. It should provide a clear explanation of the topic being researched, outline the objectives of the review, and specify the scope of the materials reviewed. This is also the place to mention the importance of your research question or hypothesis.
